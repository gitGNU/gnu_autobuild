Autobuild is a package that process output from building software,
primarily focused on packages using Autoconf and Automake, and then
generate a HTML summary file, containing links to each build log.  The
output include project name, version, build host types (cross compile
aware), compiler host name, date of build, and indication of success
or failure.  The output is indexed in many ways to simplify browsing.
