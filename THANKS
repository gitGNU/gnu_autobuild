See the end for copying conditions.

The inspiration for this package was based on earlier ad-hoc shell
scripts used by Simon Josefsson for a few projects.

The `htmlize' tool uses htmlfontify.el by Vivek Dasmohapatra.  The
name `htmlize' is due to Hrvoje Niksic; the tool htmlize used to
invoke htmlize.el, but I was never able to make it work in pure tty
mode, so I switched to htmlfontify.el.

Command line parsing, handling of --help and --version, in the
htmlize, abput* and abbuild* scripts, were taken from gendocs.sh in
Texinfo, written by Mohit Agarwal, Karl Berry et al.
