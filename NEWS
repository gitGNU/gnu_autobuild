* Version 3.2 (unreleased)

** Improved regexp's for guessing project name, revision, etc.

* Version 3.1 (released 2004-07-31)

** Bug fixes.

* Version 3.0 (released 2004-07-31)

** New commands used to upload files to compile hosts.
The generic front end "abput", and one backend "abput-sourceforge", is
included.  By simply writing a new backend, e.g., "abput-myownserver",
you can introduce new compile hosts that become available via the
generic front end.

** New commands used to build files on compile hosts.
The generic front end "abbuild", and one backend
"abbuild-sourceforge", is included.  Similar to how abput works, you
can write a new backend easily.

* Version 2.2 (released 2004-07-28)

** Guessing of project name and revision based on *.tar.gz names improved.

** Bug fixes.

* Version 2.1 (released 2004-07-14)

** Htmlize now works in batch mode.
This was accomplished by using htmlfontify.el by Vivek Dasmohapatra
instead of htmlize.el.

* Version 2.0 (released 2004-07-09)

** Autobuild and Abindex now combined into one tool "autobuild".

** New script "htmlize" replaces the Autobuild --html parameter.

** A copy of htmlize.el is now included and is installed by default.

* Version 1.5 (released 2004-07-09)

** abindex: Accepts directories as command line argument, not just files.
This is useful if you have too many files in a directory, so that
expanding wildcards in the directory overflow command line argument
size restrictions.

* Version 1.4 (released 2004-07-08)

** Don't include generated files in examples/.
The file names were too long, which causes problems with tar.  Now you
have to type 'make example.html' in examples/ yourself.

* Version 1.3 (released 2004-07-08)

** Added proper manual in doc/.

** Added example from the tutorial, in examples/.

* Version 1.2 (released 2004-07-08)

** autobuild: Values specified on the command line are now used for all
files read, when multiple filenames are supplied on command line,
instead of just for the first file as was the case before.

* Version 1.1 (released 2004-07-07)

** Fixed minor bugs discovered while writing tutorial web page.

* Version 1.0 (released 2004-07-07)

** Initial release.
