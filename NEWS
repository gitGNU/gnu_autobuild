See the end for copying conditions.

* Version 2.0 (unreleased)

** Autobuild and Abindex now combined into one tool "autobuild".

** Autobuild --html switch now moved into a separate script "htmlize".

** A copy of htmlize.el is now included and is installed by default.

* Version 1.5 (released 2004-07-09)

** abindex: Accepts directories as command line argument, not just files.
This is useful if you have too many files in a directory, so that
expanding wildcards in the directory overflow command line argument
size restrictions.

* Version 1.4 (released 2004-07-08)

** Don't include generated files in examples/.
The file names were too long, which causes problems with tar.  Now you
have to type 'make example.html' in examples/ yourself.

* Version 1.3 (released 2004-07-08)

** Added proper manual in doc/.

** Added example from the tutorial, in examples/.

* Version 1.2 (released 2004-07-08)

** autobuild: Values specified on the command line are now used for all
files read, when multiple filenames are supplied on command line,
instead of just for the first file as was the case before.

* Version 1.1 (released 2004-07-07)

** Fixed minor bugs discovered while writing tutorial web page.

* Version 1.0 (released 2004-07-07)

** Initial release.
